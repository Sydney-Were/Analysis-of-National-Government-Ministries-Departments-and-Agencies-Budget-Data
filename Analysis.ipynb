    "### Business Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "This project investigates how funds have been allocated and spent across Kenya’s national government ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs) over the past three financial years (2021/2022, 2022/2023, 2023/2024). The aim is to determine whether recurring discrepancies between approved budgets and actual expenditures exist, and if so, whether these discrepancies indicate inefficiencies, weak budget execution, or potential audit concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction — Real-world problem the project aims to solve:\n",
    "\n",
    "Kenya’s public funds must be allocated and utilized transparently to ensure accountability, efficiency, and value for money. While single-year audits provide snapshots, they often miss patterns such as persistent underspending, overspending, or repeated audit concerns. By consolidating data from three consecutive Auditor-General reports, this project will uncover long-term trends in budget allocation and execution, highlight systemic inefficiencies, and flag potential risks for audit and governance review.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stakeholders:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Auditor-General / Audit Offices: Prioritize follow-up audits on entities with repeated large variances or recurring findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Controller of Budget: Identify ministries with poor budget execution or recurring irregularities to guide hearings and budget sanctions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Policy analysts & Ministry finance teams: Target reforms (procurement, budgeting discipline, capacity building) where execution gaps are persistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. NGOs & advocacy groups: Create evidence-based transparency reports and campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Investigative journalists & researchers: Produce data-driven stories on spending patterns and accountability failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implications for the real world and stakeholders:\n",
    "\n",
    "A structured, longitudinal analysis enables detection of recurring inefficiencies and systematic audit concerns that single-year reviews miss. Findings can guide targeted audits, improve budget discipline (by showing where approved budgets routinely diverge from expenditures), and inform policy reforms (e.g., strengthening procurement controls, rolling budget ceilings, or capacity support). For civil society and media, the dataset supplies evidence for public accountability campaigns. Overall, the project strengthens governance by turning Auditor-General PDFs into persistent, actionable intelligence."
