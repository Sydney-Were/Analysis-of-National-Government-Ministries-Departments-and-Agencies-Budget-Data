    "### Business Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "This project investigates how funds have been allocated and spent across Kenya’s national government ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs) over the past four financial years (2020/2021, 2021/2022, 2022/2023, 2023/2024). The aim is to determine whether recurring discrepancies between approved budgets and actual expenditures exist, and if so, whether these discrepancies indicate inefficiencies, weak budget execution, or potential audit concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction — Real-world problem the project aims to solve:\n",
    "\n",
    "Kenya’s public funds must be allocated and utilized transparently to ensure accountability, efficiency, and value for money. While single-year audits provide snapshots, they often miss patterns such as persistent underspending, overspending, or repeated audit concerns. By consolidating data from three consecutive Auditor-General reports, this project will uncover long-term trends in budget allocation and execution, highlight systemic inefficiencies, and flag potential risks for audit and governance review.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stakeholders:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Auditor-General / Audit Offices: Prioritize follow-up audits on entities with repeated large variances or recurring findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Controller of Budget: Identify ministries with poor budget execution or recurring irregularities to guide hearings and budget sanctions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Policy analysts & Ministry finance teams: Target reforms (procurement, budgeting discipline, capacity building) where execution gaps are persistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. NGOs & advocacy groups: Create evidence-based transparency reports and campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Investigative journalists & researchers: Produce data-driven stories on spending patterns and accountability failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implications for the real world and stakeholders:\n",
    "\n",
    "A structured, longitudinal analysis enables detection of recurring inefficiencies and systematic audit concerns that single-year reviews miss. Findings can guide targeted audits, improve budget discipline (by showing where approved budgets routinely diverge from expenditures), and inform policy reforms (e.g., strengthening procurement controls, rolling budget ceilings, or capacity support). For civil society and media, the dataset supplies evidence for public accountability campaigns. Overall, the project strengthens governance by turning Auditor-General PDFs into persistent, actionable intelligence."

    "### Data sources and why they are suitable:\n",
    "This project draws on official Auditor-General reports, which provide the authoritative record of Kenya’s national government budgets, expenditures, and audit observations. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Core sources\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Auditor-General Reports (FY2020/21, FY2022/23, FY2023/24)- \n",
    "Authoritative, legally mandated audits with: (i) budget vs actuals, (ii) opinion types, (iii) control/governance findings, (iv) recurrent queries and pending bills. The 2023/24 MDAs report will anchor the latest year’s audited actuals and narrative risk signals (opinions; budget execution notes; control weaknesses). \n",
    "\n",
    "2. National Government Budget “Blue Book” (FY2021/22) - \n",
    "Official approved estimates at vote/program level—your baseline for “approved_budget” across MDAs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Kenya_National_Govt_Budget_2021_2024.csv - \n",
    "Your structured, machine-readable compilation for FY2021/22–FY2023/24 that accelerates descriptive stats, joins, and sanity checks across years (vote/MDA, approved vs actual, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. National-Government-MinistriesDepartments-And-Agencies-2023-2024.pdf - \n",
    "The latest Auditor-General MDAs report—brings detailed, vote-level audit opinions and “Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts,” plus systemic issues (e.g., pending bills, late releases, control weaknesses) to contextualize execution gaps.\n",
    "These datasets are the official, publicly available reports that include approved budgets, actual expenditures, and audit observations for ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs). They are suitable because they are government-issued, comprehensive, and structured around the exact problem of interest: budget allocation and execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Planned extraction and structuring of the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Python PDF extraction tools (pdfplumber) to pull out the “Statement of Comparison of Budget and Actual Amounts,” “Summary Statement of Appropriation,” and “Budgetary Control and Performance” sections from the PDFs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalize MDA names across years (to account for mergers, renaming, or restructuring).\n",
    "\n",
    "Build a unified dataset with the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* MDA_name\n",
    "\n",
    "* financial_year\n",
    "\n",
    "* approved_budget\n",
    "\n",
    "* actual_expenditure\n",
    "\n",
    "* variance (approved – actual)\n",
    "\n",
    "* pct_variance (variance as % of approved)\n",
    "\n",
    "* audit_observations (structured tags or extracted text)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dataset size: number of MDAs × 4 years (expected several hundred rows, depending on how many MDAs are listed per year).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Descriptive statistics to compute:\n",
    "\n",
    "* For approved and actual expenditures: count, total, mean, median, min, max, standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For variances: total variance, average % under/overspending, distribution of % variances across MDAs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Frequency of MDAs with significant underspending (>5%), overspending (>0%), or within tolerance (±5%).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Audit observations summarized by category (e.g., procurement irregularities, unsupported expenditures, late disbursements).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Justification for chosen features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* MDA_name and financial_year are necessary identifiers for longitudinal analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Approved_budget and actual_expenditure form the basis of budget execution analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Variance and pct_variance allow comparisons across MDAs regardless of size.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Audit_observations provide explanatory context for discrepancies and help flag recurring governance issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations of the data and implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Format inconsistency: reports are published as PDFs with mixed tables and text, requiring a hybrid extraction strategy and some manual cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Naming inconsistencies: some MDAs change names or merge, which complicates longitudinal tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Accounting basis differences: reporting conventions may differ slightly year to year, affecting comparability.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Granularity limits: Blue Books and Audit Reports provide institution-level data but not always project-level detail, limiting root-cause analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Audit text variability: audit observations are qualitative and may require natural language processing or manual tagging to be comparable across years.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mitigation strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Combine automated extraction with manual review for problematic entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Maintain a canonical MDA name mapping across years.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clearly document assumptions and cleaning steps in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Include a confidence flag for parsed figures (high when numbers are extracted from tables, lower when parsed from narrative text)."

These engineered features make the data more interpretable and allow us to perform more meaningful comparisons across ministries, departments, and years.  \n",

    "### Features Added\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Utilization Rate (%)**  \n",
    "   - Formula: `Actual Expenditure ÷ Approved Budget × 100`  \n",
    "   - Shows how much of the allocated funds were actually spent.  \n",
    "   - A rate close to 100% indicates good budget execution, while very low or very high rates suggest under-spending or overspending.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Spending Status**  \n",
    "   - Categories: **Overspent**, **Underspent**, **On Budget**  \n",
    "   - Provides a quick, categorical classification of each ministry’s spending behavior.  \n",
    "   - Helps us identify recurring patterns of overspending or underspending across different years.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Audit Flag**  \n",
    "   - Value: **1** if the variance exceeds ±10% of the approved budget, else **0**.  \n",
    "   - Highlights ministries that deviate significantly from their budgets.  \n",
    "   - This threshold-based flag makes it easy to detect potential inefficiencies or red flags that auditors should investigate further.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "- These engineered features allow us to move from raw numbers to **actionable insights**.  \n",
    "- They enable comparisons between ministries of different budget sizes on a relative scale (e.g., Utilization Rate instead of just raw variance).  \n",
    "- They create the foundation for **hypothesis testing, trend analysis, clustering** later in the project.  \n",
    "- Ultimately, they help answer our core question:  \n",
    "  *Which ministries consistently manage their budgets effectively, and which ones show recurring inefficiencies or audit risks?*\n"

    "- Approved vs Actual Expenditure: 0.78 (Strong Positive Correlation)\n",
    "\n",
    "  There is a strong alignment between what was approved and what was actually spent.\n",
    "\n",
    "  This suggests that, in general, MDAs are spending in line with their approved budgets, which reflects positively on budget adherence and financial discipline.\n",
    "\n",
    "  However, while correlation is strong, it's still not perfect — further analysis should assess outliers or specific MDAs with large deviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Budget Size vs % Variance: 0.04 (Very Weak Positive Correlation)\n",
    "\n",
    "  The size of the budget has almost no relationship with how accurately it is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "  This implies that both large and small budgets are equally prone to overspending or underspending.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Budget execution issues are not limited to a particular scale of funding, indicating systemic challenges across MDAs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Utilization vs Actual Expenditure: -0.02 (Negative Correlation)\n",
    "\n",
    "  Surprisingly, there's virtually no correlation between utilization rate and actual expenditure.\n",
    "  This is unexpected, as utilization is typically derived from actual expenditure. A weak negative correlation may suggest a wide variability in approved budgets that distorts the relationship.\n"

    "#### Why NLP?? \n",
    "We are using NLP because the Auditor General’s reports and budget documents are mostly in unstructured text and tables, making it difficult to analyze with traditional methods. NLP allows us to clean, tokenize, and extract key entities like ministries, years, and budget amounts directly from the text. By applying NLP, we can normalize naming inconsistencies, link narrative descriptions with financial figures, and ensure accurate search and retrieval. Ultimately, NLP transforms raw reports into structured, analyzable data that supports comparisons, anomaly detection, and budget performance insights."

The tuned XGBoost model achieved an RMSE of ~4.67e11 and R² of ~0.90, showing a substantial improvement. This suggests that budget allocations follow systematic patterns tied to ministries, entities, and project descriptions.

    "## Insights and recommendations \n",
    "Financial & Policy Recommendations\n",
    "1. Address Chronic Underspending.\n",
    "Several MDAs consistently underspend their approved budgets. This points to absorption challenges and inefficiencies in project execution.\n",
    "Action: Review procurement and implementation bottlenecks, and revise budget ceilings for recurrent underspenders to better align resources with capacity.\n",
    "2. Tighten Oversight on Overspending MDAs.\n",
    "Overspending cases pose significant financial risks.\n",
    "Action: Establish a red-flag threshold (e.g., >120% budget utilization) that automatically triggers audits or closer monitoring.\n",
    "3. Audit Prioritization Using Clusters.\n",
    "With nearly 70% of MDAs flagged, resources for auditing should be allocated strategically.\n",
    "Action: Prioritize overspenders and extreme underspenders, while maintaining light-touch monitoring of efficient MDAs.\n",
    "4. Improve Budget Forecasting & Planning.\n",
    "Persistent variance between approved budgets and actuals suggests weak forecasting mechanisms.\n",
    "Action: Require evidence-based justifications for allocations, and apply historical performance trends when setting future ceilings.\n",
    "5. Capacity Building for Low-Performing MDAs.\n",
    "Low utilization rates often reflect weak planning and reporting capacity.\n",
    "Action: Provide training and technical support, simplify fund disbursement procedures, and strengthen accountability frameworks.\n",
    "6. Strengthen Budget Formulation.\n",
    "Require MDAs to justify allocations with detailed implementation capacity assessments (staffing, procurement readiness, past absorption rates).\n",
    "Adopt evidence-based budgeting where future allocations are tied to past budget utilization trends.\n",
    "7. Introduce Performance Contracts.\n",
    "Tie senior management performance appraisals to budget absorption KPIs (e.g., ≥90% execution rate).\n",
    "Use dashboards to flag anomalies in real time (based on cluster membership).\n",
    "8. Capacity Building & Digitalization.\n",
    "Train MDA finance departments on planning, reporting, and monitoring.\n",
    "Enhance the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) to automatically track variance and trigger alerts."
